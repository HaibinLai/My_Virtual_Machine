# Implementing Virtual Machine Using C Language

This is a virtual machine written in C, supporting the RISC-V instruction set.

## How does a VM works?
A VM creates one standard CPU architecture which is simulated on various hardware devices. One advantage of a compiler is that it has no runtime overhead while a VM does. Even though compilers do a pretty good job, writing a new one that targets multiple platforms is very difficult, so VMs are still helpful here. In practice, VMs and compilers are mixed at various levels.

## Features

- **Instruction Set**: Supports RISC-V
- **Build Tool**: Compiled using Makefile

## Installation

Make sure you have [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and the necessary compilers installed.

```bash
git clone https://your-repo-url.git
cd your-repo-directory
make


## Usage

After compilation, you can run the virtual machine with the following command:

```bash
./your-vm-executable
```
